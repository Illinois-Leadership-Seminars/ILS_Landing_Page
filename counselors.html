                        At ILS, we have recruited thousands of outstanding high school sophomores to attend our free,
                        three-day leadership seminar.

                    Leadership Seminar (ILS)?</a>
                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>For over 30 years we have been unleashing the leadership potential of Illinois youth. ILS is
                        an opportunity for students to be around other outstanding leaders their own age. Sometimes,
                        students are nervous about attending a seminar where they don’t know anyone, but to us, that’s
                        the best part! ILS is a fresh start. There’s no pressure from your peers to be anything or
                        conform to any mold. That’s just one of the many unique things about ILS. Students get to
                        explore their own leadership potential away from their home comfort zone.</p>
                    <p>Our message to students is simple. “No matter your gender, your ethnicity, your religion, your
                        socioeconomic background, no matter where you come from… you (yes YOU!) can be a leader.”</p>
                    <p>Counselors all over the state love sending students to ILS not only for the rave reviews they
                        receive upon the student’s return, but because they see a REAL change in the students they
                        have nominated over the years after attending our program. It’s an awesome feeling to know
                        that YOU helped a young person find confidence in their own leadership abilities and we are
                        eternally grateful to our outstanding counselors who send us extraordinary students year
                        after year.</p>

                    <p>The 2017 Illinois Leadership Seminar will take place June 9, 10, and 11 (Friday, Saturday, and
                        Sunday) at North Park University in Chicago, IL on the north side.

                        Yes, your student must be at North Park University from Check-In early Friday morning until the
                        Closing Ceremony on Sunday
                        afternoon. We cannot allow students to arrive late, leave and come back, or leave early for
                        any reason. Sponsors have paid for each student to attend ILS in its entirety and we ask
                        that each student honor that sponsorship by fully committing to the weekend.

                        We recognize that while a majority of schools are finished with the semester and on summer
                        break, some schools in Illinois
                        are still in session or taking finals during our seminar. We understand the conflict, however,
                        we ask that students reschedule their final(s) and/or get an excused absence for Friday,
                        June 3, the first day of our seminar.

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>
                        We leave the choice of who to pick for our seminar, and how to pick them entirely up to the
                        counselor, so long as the student
                        selected is currently in their
                        <b>sophomore</b> year of high school (they will attend ILS during the summer between their
                        sophomore
                        and junior year). Counselors utilize a variety of different selection methods including essay
                        contests, faculty vote, and if one student stands out right away, it’s perfectly acceptable
                        to hand pick a student without a formal evaluation. Sometimes it is even helpful to have
                        students who have attended our seminar in the past recommend a sophomore. After all, they
                        have been through the program and know what we are looking for, too. Past leaders have excelled
                        academically, in athletics, in co-curricular activities, or in community service. Despite
                        the fact that our seminar attracts high caliber students, we’re not necessarily looking for
                        students with the perfect leadership resume. Leadership
                        <b>potential</b> is the common denominator at ILS and sometimes the students who get the most
                        out of our seminar have that leadership potential hidden down a little bit deeper than their
                        peers. Please look for an exceptional student who you believe represents the potential of
                        your student body.

                        Download and print our student nomination form. Please give this form to your selected student
                        and explain that they have
                        been chosen to represent your school at ILS. This form instructs students to go to our website
                        and read through the entire “Students” tab when they get home. Parents are also encouraged
                        to read through the “Parents” tab. Each tab has information geared towards a specific audience,
                        much like this tab is geared towards counselors. After each student has read through all
                        the information on the “Students” tab and has discussed attending ILS 2017 with his or her
                        parents, they are instructed to fill out the bottom of the form accurately and turn it back
                        in to you so you can nominate them online.

                        Do not login to our system until the student has completed this form on their own and you have
                        it with you. We understand
                        that most schools have a data base of student contact information that you can pull from
                        when nominating a student. However, we need the student to verify that their information
                        is up to date and accurate, especially their email address and phone number. Many students
                        now have school issued email addresses, but we insist on having an email addresses for both
                        our students and parents that are frequently checked since email will be our primary means
                        of communication with our nominated students and parents into the summer. Be sure your student
                        has their nomination form filled out completely and accurately before you begin their nomination
                        online.

                        Passcode you need to login, is provided in your individualized nomination email. All the
                        school contacts in our system will receive the nomination email in mid-November when we
                        officially
                        open nomination. If mid-November has passed and you have not received this email, please
                        contact our Recruitment Director, Amber Dalgaard, at ilsrecruitmentdirector@gmail.com. We
                        will promptly send you all the information you need.

                        ILS is filled on a first come, first served basis. Students will still have a deadline to
                        complete their registration after
                        they have been nominated. We have room for 110 students at our seminar. In mid-November we
                        will open nomination and nomination instruction emails will be sent out to all counselors
                        in our system. We expect to be full in one month. Our seminar is very popular and a lot of
                        schools want to send students to ILS. To be safe, we recommend you begin your school’s selection
                        process now, especially if your school has an essay contest or another form of selection
                        that may take longer. Nomination will be closed as soon as 110 schools have nominated a student,
                        no exceptions. There will be a nomination counter at the top of this page (updated bi-weekly)
                        that lets you know how many spots are left. We encourage you to submit your nomination before
                        the holiday break.

                    <p>
                        If seminar is full by the time you have selected your student, you can email our Recruitment
                        Director and request a spot
                        on the waiting list. If a spot opens up later, we will contact you and allow you to nominate
                        your student. Please do this if we are full! Our nomination numbers are completely dependent
                        on finances and if fundraising goes better than expected, our Corporate Board may authorize
                        us to invite more students. Also, some nominated students may not complete their registration
                        online by their deadline. In that case, we will also draw from schools on our waiting list
                        to fill their spots. Your school cannot be selected in these situations if you do not email
                        us and request a spot on the waiting list.

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>Once a student has been nominated, it is the student’s responsibility to sit down with their
                        parents and/or legal guardians at home to register for our seminar. Students will receive
                        a personalized email with instructions on how to register online for our seminar. These emails
                        should be sent out once a week beginning in January. We will inform each counselor when their
                        student has received their registration email.</p>
                    <p>We understand that some students may be nominated for some time before they can register, but
                        we are waiting to focus on registration until we have most of our nominations in. All
                        information
                        obtained during the registration process will remain confidential. We need to have accurate
                        medical information on file for the safety of our participants and staff. Registering for
                        our seminar should take your student no longer than ten minutes if they complete it with
                        their parents.</p>
                    <p>Students must complete their registration within two weeks of receiving their registration email.
                        If the deadline has passed, and your student has not completed registration, your school’s
                        spot at seminar will be forfeited to another school on the waiting list.</p>
                    <p>Please follow up with your student and make sure they have registered for ILS. We really
                        appreciate
                        all you do and while it is not your responsibility to register the student, sometimes students
                        forget and a little nudge never hurt. We don’t want your school’s spot at ILS forfeited because
                        a student forgot to register on time.</p>

                <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="0">What about selecting and nominating an alternate, how does that
                    work?</a>
                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>
                        Nominating an alternate student in the event your primary selection cannot attend is a good
                        idea, but it is completely optional.
                        You do not have to nominate an alternate if you do not want to. Remember, only one sophomore
                        student from each high school is eligible to attend ILS. We would reach out to the alternate
                        student in the event that the primary student has already registered and cannot attend seminar
                        because of a conflict or family emergency. We will set a “reply by” date for each alternate
                        on a case by case basis depending on how close we are to seminar. If they do not respond
                        to us in time, we will offer that spot to a school on the waiting list. If your primary student
                        fails to register by the deadline, this automatically disqualifies your school from
                        participation
                        in the 2017 Illinois Leadership Seminar. In that case, we would not offer your primary student’s
                        spot to your alternate. Instead, we would draw from our waiting list of schools that did
                        not get a chance to nominate before we were full. This is another reason to be certain your
                        primary student plans on registering and attending seminar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Follow the same process (with the nomination form) for your alternate student, but be sure to
                        inform them that they are the
                        alternate and will only be attending if your primary student is unable to attend. When you
                        have completed the nomination for your primary student in our system simply click the link
                        at the bottom of the screen and add your alternate attendee.

                        Students are pre-divided into groups of 8-10 leaders. The group is led by one Senior Coach who
                        is assisted by two alumni
                        of the seminar, Junior Coaches. During the weekend students will have an opportunity to interact
                        with other students from all groups. As for the actual content and schedule, we are purposefully
                        vague. We have found that our leaders have a better experience if they don’t know what is
                        coming next. If you have specific questions, you can contact our Recruitment Director, Amber
                        Dalgaard, at ilsrecruitmentdirector@gmail.com. We challenge our students to share their own
                        thoughts and ideas about issues facing their schools, their communities, and our world. The
                        program is not designed to teach students what to think, or even how to think, but rather
                        to emphasize the importance of critical thinking skills in leadership roles.

                        Only current sophomores can be nominated for our seminar. Therefore, they will attend seminar in
                        June between their sophomore
                        and junior years. We feel that the transition from underclassmen to upperclassmen is an
                        underrated
                        transition and the perfect time to reach young student leaders.

                        Absolutely. We work very hard all year long to make sure that no student has to pay to attend
                        the Illinois Leadership Seminar.
                        All meals (beginning with lunch on Friday), housing, and overhead has been paid for. Sponsors
                        include GFWCs (Women’s Clubs), Gallup Inc., and alumni of the seminar itself. Schools, parents,
                        and students incur no costs with the exception of transportation to and from our seminar
                        site.

                        We only allow each high school to send one student to our seminar each year. This ensures that
                        we have a diverse group of
                        students from all over the state and that we are able to offer the seminar to a larger number
                        of high schools. We have found that students are also more willing to explore their own
                        leadership
                        potential if they don’t know any other students prior to attending. You may nominate an
                        alternate
                        in case your primary student cannot attend at the last minute.

                        school sophomore from your school
                        for a free leadership seminar. You can reply and let us know who the correct contact should

                        and nominating our students because they are exposed to the widest variety of students, but
                        we have teachers and administrators who nominate students as well.

                        Please look again! Often, students need an extra nudge to commit to stepping out of their
                        comfort zone. Other students may
                        be unsure of what the program entails, worried that they don’t know anyone else attending,
                        etc. If you don’t have a volunteer for ILS, select a student who you think would benefit.
                        EVERY high school in Illinois has a sophomore student with leadership potential. Let them
                        know it is an honor to be chosen! Have past ILS alumni talk to the students, encourage them,
                        and please let us know if you have any additional questions!
