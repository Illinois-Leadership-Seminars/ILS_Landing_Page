                    <p>
                        Illinois Leadership Seminars is a non-profit, 100% volunteer organization with one mission: to
                        unleash the leadership potential
                        of Illinois youth. We accomplish this mission in two major ways. First, we provide students all
                        over the state with an opportunity to attend a free leadership seminar. Second, after a student
                        has gone through one of our programs, they have the option to stay involved with our alumni
                        association.
                        The alumni association provides our students with an active nationwide network of successful
                        leaders to rely on for support with everything from advice on how to run a high school pep rally
                        to college applications and job interviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have been selected to go through phase one of our program by attending our free, three-day
                        leadership seminar.

                    <p>
                        We reach out to high school counselors and administrators all over the state and ask them to
                        select one outstanding sophomore
                        from their high school to attend our seminar. We leave who to select and how to select them
                        totally
                        up to the schools. Some schools have a private staff vote, some hold an essay contest, and some
                        counselors just hand pick a student on their own. No matter how our students are selected, they
                        all have one awesome thing in common: leadership
                        <i>potential</i>.

                        ILS is an opportunity to be around other outstanding leaders your own age. Sometimes, students
                        are nervous about attending
                        a seminar where they don’t know anyone, but to us, that’s the best part! ILS is a fresh start.
                        There’s no pressure from your peers to be anything or conform to any mold. At ILS we encourage
                        you to be one thing… you.

                        Our message is simple. No matter your gender, your ethnicity, your religion, your socioeconomic
                        background, no matter where
                        you come from… you (yes YOU!) can be a leader. We aim to unleash the leadership potential that
                        is already in YOU.

                    <p>
                        Open spots at our seminar are in high demand and we typically have a 40-50 student waiting list
                        for our program. If you decide
                        ILS is not right for you, please contact our Recruitment Director, Amber Dalgaard, at
                        <a href="mailto:ilsrecruitmentdirector@gmail.com">ilsrecruitmentdirector@gmail.com</a> as soon

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>You must sit down with your parents or legal guardian and register online for our seminar. Your
                        counselor
                        has already nominated you to attend ILS, but your spot is not reserved until you complete the
                        online registration process. The sooner you register, the sooner we can reserve your seat at
                        seminar. </p>
                    <p>All students will receive a personalized email with registration instructions and the codes they
                        will need to register. Registration emails will be sent out at the beginning of each week
                        beginning
                        in January. If you have not completed registration by your deadline, we will cancel your
                        nomination
                        and give your spot to schools and students on our waiting list. </p>
                    <p>Registration is a very simple process that should not take longer than 10 minutes. The step by
                        step
                        instructions are very easy to follow, so please read the entire email. We understand that some
                        leaders will be nominated for a while before they can register, but we are waiting to focus on
                        registration until we have all of our nominations in. Your counselor will also receive a
                        notification
                        when we have sent out registration instructions. </p>
                    <p>Please read through all of the Frequently Asked Questions before you complete the online
                        registration
                        process. You need to understand what you are committing to before you register.</p>

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>Before we answer that, let’s get some ILS lingo out of the way. All of our participants are
                        referred
                        to as “leaders" throughout the weekend. So from here on out, “leader" refers to a student who
                        is attending our program, in this case, you!</p>
                    <p>The program includes motivational speakers, leadership activities, group discussions, and a whole
                        lot more. During the ILS experience, a broad spectrum of leaders will address various aspects
                        of leadership in our changing world and the challenges future leaders will confront. You will
                        have the opportunity to ask questions of the speakers and participate in small group discussions
                        throughout the seminar. This is a dynamic weekend!We will conclude Friday evening with a dance
                        and Saturday evening with the Leader Showcase.</p>
                    <p>The program is not designed to teach leaders what to think, or even how to think, but instead
                        bring
                        out the leader already inside them by emphasizing the importance of critical thinking skills
                        in leadership roles.</p>

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>The Leader Showcase on Saturday night is a talent show starring our leaders. We recognize that in
                        addition to possessing great leadership potential, our students also possess many special
                        talents.
                        If you can sing, rap, play an instrument, twirl a baton, or recite poetry, we want you to “bring
                        it"?! If you want to display some artwork, that’s great too! Performing is optional, but as long
                        as it’s appropriate, we would love for you to showcase your talents and abilities at the Leader
                        Showcase on Saturday night. Please remember to bring anything you need for the Leader Showcase
                        with you to Check-In.</p>

                    <p>
                        Once a leader has registered for our seminar, they are assigned to a group of 8-10 leaders.
                        These groups are totally random
                        to insure each leader is exposed to other leaders with different backgrounds. Each group has
                        one Sr. Staff member (a Sr. Coach) and two Jr. Staff members (Jr. Coaches). Different seminar
                        activities require different levels of participation. Some highly interactive activities and
                        discussions will be done within the small group, while other activities will be done as a large
                        seminar group. You will have an opportunity to interact with leaders from every group at some
                        point during the weekend.

                        Absolutely. We work very hard all year long to make sure that no student has to pay to attend
                        the Illinois Leadership Seminar.
                        All meals (beginning with lunch on Friday), housing, and overhead has been paid for. Sponsors
                        include GFWCs (Women’s Clubs), Gallup Inc., and alumni of the seminar itself. Schools, parents,
                        and students incur no costs with the exception of transportation to and from our seminar site.

                        Once checked-in, your parents can accompany you to your dorm room to drop off your luggage.
                        Finally, you will find your small
                        group where you can meet your Senior Coach and the rest of your group for the weekend. It is
                        not mandatory that your parents accompany you to Check-In or to the dorms, however, they are
                        more than welcome to if they would like.

                    <p>
                        Each leader is responsible for getting themselves to North Park University at Check-In and home
                        after Check-Out. Please plan
                        ahead. Some of our leaders literally live five minutes away from campus. Others live five hours
                        away from Chicago. Whatever your individual transportation situation is, we ask that you do your
                        best to plan ahead. We understand that getting to North Park University is more difficult for
                        some parents and leaders than others. If you would like to carpool or are willing give someone
                        in your area a ride, please check the carpool option on the transportation page when you
                        register.
                        Our Recruitment Director will send out an email with the contact information of everyone who
                        indicated they would like to carpool during registration about a month before seminar. Beyond
                        that, we cannot set up any carpool/ride share program. Please be respectful of everyone on the
                        list and honor their wishes if they choose to no longer participate.

                        If a parent is your transportation to seminar, please make sure they are free Friday morning! Do
                        not assume that your mom
                        or dad is automatically available to bring you. Friday is a business day and many parents still
                        have to work. Check with your parents before committing them to drive you to seminar and make
                        sure they know Check-In is EARLY on Friday morning, June 3rd.

                        Some leaders choose to drive themselves to seminar. If that option works best for you, please
                        park in the visitor parking
                        lot on the southeast corner of Kedzie and Foster Avenues. Parking is free for the entire

                        the spot to another student.

                        All of our staff and leaders will be staying in dorms on campus. There will be all male floors
                        and all female floors reserved
                        exclusively for ILS (i.e. participants from other activities going on at North Park University
                        will not be on the same floors as ILS participants). Access to each floor is restricted to
                        leaders
                        and staff rooming on that floor by each individual key card. Therefore, no male can access a
                        female floor and no female can access a male floor. You will have one or two other leaders of
                        the same gender as roommates for the weekend. Each floor will have an emergency adult contact
                        on call whenever leaders are in the dorms. Staff members are strictly prohibited from EVER
                        entering
                        the dorm room of a leader. Leaders will not be allowed to go back to the dorms during the day.

                        leading up to seminar. It
                        is imperative that we have an accurate email address for you on file. If your parents check
                        their
                        email more often and they would prefer we send information to them instead, that’s fine, we can
                        use their email address. The reminders are primarily meant for you, but they can pass the
                        information
                        along.

                        also from your Sr. Coach in late May. When you register, please be sure to list an accurate
                        phone
                        number where we can get a hold of you. If an incorrect phone number is listed, we have no way
                        to call you. Amber will be calling to confirm transportation plans. Each Sr. Coach will be
                        calling
                        to ease any pre-seminar concerns and answer any questions you may have, but if your parents have
                        questions they would like to ask, your Sr. Coach is available as a resource.

                        Students come into seminar with a wide range of expectations. The best advice we can give a
                        student before attending our
                        program is to remember that usually what you get out of any experience is directly tied to what
                        you put into it. We always tell our leaders to approach the Illinois Leadership Seminar with
                        an open heart, an open mind, and a positive attitude. For the students who follow that advice,
                        well, let’s just say that whatever their expectations about ILS were before the weekend are
                        usually
                        blown out of the water…
