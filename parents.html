                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>Illinois Leadership Seminars is a non-profit, 100% volunteer organization with one mission: to
                        unleash
                        the leadership potential of Illinois youth. We accomplish this mission in two major ways. First,
                        we provide students all over the state with an opportunity to attend a free leadership seminar.
                        Second, after a student has gone through one of our programs, they have the option to stay
                        involved
                        with our Alumni Association. The Alumni Association provides our students with an active
                        nationwide
                        network of successful leaders to rely on for support with everything from advice on how to run
                        a high school pep rally to college applications and job interviews.</p>
                    <p>
                        Your son or daughter has been selected to go through phase one of our program by attending our
                        free, three-day leadership
                        seminar.

                <div class="cd-faq-content">
                    <p>We reach out to high school counselors and administrators all over the state and ask them to
                        select
                        one outstanding sophomore from their high school to attend our seminar. We leave who to select
                        and how to select them totally up to the schools. Some schools have a private staff vote, some
                        hold an essay contest, and some counselors just hand pick a student on their own. No matter how
                        our students are selected, they all have one awesome thing in common:
                        <i>leadership potential</i>.</p>

                    <p>
                        ILS is an opportunity for your son or daughter to be around other outstanding leaders their own
                        age. Sometimes, students
                        are nervous about attending a seminar where they don’t know anyone, but to us, that’s the best
                        part! ILS is a fresh start. Our message is simple. No matter your gender, your ethnicity, your
                        religion, your socioeconomic background, no matter where you come from… you (yes YOU!) can be
                        a leader.

                    <p>
                        Open spots at our seminar are in high demand and we typically have a 40-50 student waiting list
                        for our program. If you decide
                        ILS is not right for your son or daughter, please let us (and your son or daughter’s counselor)
                        know as soon as possible so we can offer the opportunity to another student.

                        You must sit down with your son or daughter and register online for our seminar. Even if your
                        child’s counselor has already
                        nominated them to attend ILS, their spot is not reserved until they complete the online
                        registration
                        process. The sooner you register your son or daughter, the sooner we can reserve their seat at
                        seminar.

                            they
                            will need to register. Registration emails will be sent out at the beginning of each week
                            starting in January. If they have not completed registration by the deadline, we will cancel
                            their nomination and give their spot to schools and students on our waiting list.</b>

                        Registration is a very simple process that should not take longer than 10 minutes. The step by
                        step instructions are very
                        easy to follow, so please read the entire email. We understand that some leaders will be
                        nominated
                        for a while before they can register, but we are waiting to focus on registration until we have
                        all of the nominations in. Your son or daughter’s counselor will also receive a notification
                        when we have sent out registration instructions.

                    <p>Before we answer that, let’s get some ILS lingo out of the way. All of our participants are
                        referred
                        to as “leaders” throughout the weekend. So from here on out, “leader” refers to a student who
                        is attending our program, in this case, your son or daughter.</p>
                    <p>All of our staff and leaders will be staying in dorms on campus. There will be all male floors
                        and
                        all female floors reserved exclusively for ILS (i.e. participants from other events going on
                        at North Park University will not be on the same floors as ILS participants). Access to each
                        floor is restricted to leaders rooming on that floor by each participant’s key card. Therefore,
                        no male can access a female floor and no female can access a male floor. Your son or daughter
                        will have one or two other leaders of the same gender as roommates for the weekend. Each floor
                        will have an emergency adult contact on call whenever leaders are in the dorms. Staff members
                        are strictly prohibited from
                        <i>EVER</i> entering the dorm room of a leader. Leaders will not be allowed to go back to the
                        dorms
                        during the day. Therefore, leaders only have two reasons to be in their dorms throughout the
                        weekend, to drop off their luggage and to sleep.</p>

                        Our Staff is divided into two groups, Jr. Staff and Sr. Staff. Your child will be assigned to a
                        group which will be staffed
                        by one Senior coach and two Junior coaches. Our Jr. Staff are all alumni of the seminar. They
                        are ages 16-20 and have several different roles operating under the direction of our Sr. Staff
                        throughout the weekend. Our leader to Jr. Staff ratio is about 3:1. Our Sr. Staff are adult
                        volunteers,
                        21 and older, most of whom are alumni of the seminar. Our leader to Sr. Staff ratio is about
                        5:1. Adults from many different backgrounds volunteer at our seminar. All of our staff members
                        go through a rigorous application process and every staff member ages 18 and older undergoes
                        a background check conducted by our Corporate Board. This ensures that we always have the best
                        staff on hand to assist your son or daughter all weekend.

                        the Illinois Leadership Seminar.
                        All meals (beginning with lunch on Friday), housing, and overhead have been paid for. Sponsors
                        include GFWCs (Women’s Clubs), Gallup Inc., and alumni of the seminar itself. Schools, parents,
                        and students incur no costs with the exception of transportation to and from our seminar site.

                        All of our staff members are volunteers. Not a single Corporate Board member, Seminar Planning
                        Committee member, Alumni Board
                        member, coach, speaker, panelist, or any other staff member gets paid. We do this because, quite
                        simply, we believe in your son or daughter. Most of our staff have actually been through the
                        seminar themselves and were so moved by the weekend that they choose to give back year after
                        year. We actually have to turn away volunteers for the weekend because so many people want to
                        help with ILS.

                        Check-In times will be EARLY morning on Friday, June 9th. Please plan ahead and consider that
                        there may be traffic on Friday
                        morning. When you arrive at North Park University, please park in the free visitor parking lot
                        on the southeast corner of Kedzie and Foster Avenues, across from McDonalds. Cross Kedzie Avenue
                        and Illinois Leadership Seminars volunteers will meet you at the front steps of Hamming Hall
                        (number 12 on the campus map) and direct you to Check-In. Please bring everything you will need
                        for the weekend (including your signed consent form) with you.

                    <p>
                        At Check-In on Friday morning, please be sure you clearly indicate who will be picking your son
                        or daughter up on Sunday.
                        For your child’s own safety, we will not release them on Sunday to someone not listed on their
                        Check-In form. If there may be several different people picking your child up on Sunday, please
                        list them all.

                    <p>
                        Once checked-in, you can accompany your son or daughter to their dorm room to drop off their
                        luggage. Finally, you will leave
                        them with their small group where you can meet their Senior Coach for the weekend. It is not
                        mandatory that you accompany your son or daughter to Check-In or to their dorms, however, you
                        are more than welcome to if you would like.

                        daughter has a conflict that prevents them from attending the entire seminar, please let us know
                        ASAP so we can find a replacement.

                        Each leader is responsible for getting themselves to North Park University at Check-In and home
                        after Check-Out. Please plan
                        ahead. Some of our leaders literally live five minutes away from campus. Others live five hours
                        away from Chicago. Whatever your individual transportation situation is, we ask that you do your
                        best to plan ahead. We understand that getting to North Park University is more difficult for
                        some parents and leaders than others. If you would like to carpool or are willing give someone
                        in your area a ride, please check the carpool option on the transportation page when you
                        register.
                        Our Recruitment Director will send out an email with the contact information of everyone who
                        indicated they would like to carpool during registration about a month before seminar. Beyond
                        that, we cannot set up any carpool/ride share program. Please be respectful of everyone on the
                        list and honor their wishes if they choose to no longer participate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are your son or daughter’s transportation to seminar, please make sure you are free
                        Friday morning! Friday is a business
                        day and we understand that many parents have to work. Before committing to drive your son or
                        daughter to seminar, please be aware that Check-In is EARLY on Friday morning, June 9th and
                        remember
                        that we require of our leaders to be at North Park University on time.

                    <p>
                        Some leaders choose to drive themselves to seminar. If that option works best, they can park in
                        the visitor parking lot on
                        the southeast corner of Kedzie and Foster Avenues. Parking is free for the entire seminar.

                        seminar site, please let us know
                        ASAP so we can offer the spot to another student.

                        Unfortunately, no, we can’t. It’s not that we don’t want to help, but making recommendations
                        about where parents and families
                        should stay for the weekend, if you plan on doing so, is a liability issue. Chicago has an
                        abundance
                        of practical transportation tools as well as hotel options. If you do plan on making this a

                        cannot make any recommendations.

                        just the beginning. During
                        the ILS experience, a broad spectrum of leaders will address various aspects of leadership in
                        our changing world and the challenges future leaders will confront. You will have the
                        opportunity
                        to ask questions of the speakers and participate in small group discussions throughout the
                        seminar.
                        This is a dynamic weekend! We will conclude Friday evening with a dance and Saturday evening

                        The program is not designed to teach students what to think, or even how to think, but rather to
                        emphasize the importance
                        of critical thinking skills in leadership roles.

                    <p>
                        Once a leader has registered for our seminar, they are assigned to a small group of 8-10
                        leaders. These groups are totally
                        random to ensure each leader is exposed to other leaders with different backgrounds. Each group
                        has one Senior Coach and two Junior Coaches. Different seminar activities require different
                        levels
                        of participation. Some highly interactive activities and discussions will be done within the
                        small group, while other activities will be done as a large seminar group. Your son or daughter
                        will have an opportunity to interact with leaders from every group at some point during the
                        weekend.

                        are primarily meant for them. However, if you would prefer that we send you the reminder emails,
                        please list your email address when you register your child. You can then pass on any pertinent
                        information to your son or daughter when you receive the reminders.

                        in early May and also from their Sr. Coach in late May. When you register, please be sure to
                        list an accurate phone number where we can get a hold of your son or daughter. If an incorrect
                        phone number is listed, we have no way to call them. Amber will be calling to verify
                        transportation
                        plans. Each Sr. Coach will be calling to ease any pre-seminar concerns and answer any questions
                        your son or daughter may have, but if you have questions they would like to ask, your son or
                        daughter’s Sr. Coach is available as a resource.

                        We understand that things come up, but if they do, please let us know! There is a long waiting
                        list of Illinois students
                        who want to participate in this weekend and if your son or daughter is unable to attend, we
                        would
                        like to offer this opportunity to someone on our alternate list. You can email our Recruitment
                        Director, Amber Dalgaard, at ilsrecruitmentdirector@gmail.com or give her a call at the phone
                        number listed at the bottom of your registration email.
